Things to do:
Fixes:
Fix whatever is up with the sprites.
Updates:
Change builders to require aluminium.
Add bronze + bronze alloyer (4 copper + 1 aluminium = 4 bronze).
Make turrets use bronze (artillery? basics? all?).
Make turrets require steel (or iron for low tier).
Give lithium additional uses (making cryo?).
Make all projectors + vault + command center require steel.
Add more elements + associated alloys! (Tungsten? Silver? Gold? Uranium?)
