Things to do:
Fix the smelting sprites for irradiator and bismuth crucible.
Fix the liquid sprites for sifter.
Add steel walls (maybe aluminium + iron?).
Change air drones + phantoms to require aluminium.
Add bronze + bronze alloyer (4 copper + 1 aluminium = 4 bronze).
Make turrets use bronze (artillery? basics? all?).
Make turrets require steel (or iron for low tier).
Give lithium additional uses (Li + Al for walls? making cryo?).
Make all projectors + vault + command center require steel.
Add more elements + associated alloys! (Tungsten? Silver? Gold? Uranium?)
