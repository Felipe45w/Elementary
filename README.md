# Elementary

A mod for mindustry that adds more elements including iron, aluminium, lithium, and more!

## Newest Update: V0.6

New things:
- Updated texture for induction smelter, sifter, and bismuth.
- 2 new Sniper style turrets, Shine and Glare.
- New power generator, the surge generator.
- New 1X1 tile drill.
- Cryofluid Makers now use lithium also.
- Several build costs have been modified.

## All feautures added by this mod

### Items:

Iron:
- Similar to copper, used for some construction.

Steel:
- A strong alloy used in the construction of many blocks.

Lithium:
- A reactive weak metal used for batteries and making coolant.

Bismuth:
- A slightly radioactive material that can be turned into thorium.

Bauxite:
- An ore of aluminium, but be refined before it is useful.

Aluminium:
- A lightweight metal used for aerial drones and for larger walls.

Bronze:
- An alloy which can be used as ammo, or to make special drones.

## Liquids:

Molten Bismuth:
- Bismuth that's been heated to high temperatures.

Muddy Water:
- Sand suspended in water.

## New Blocks:

Steel Walls:
- Has a large and small variant, health is comparable to titanium.

Aluminium Walls:
- Has a large and small variant, which are 4x4 and 2x2 respectively.

Lithium Battery:
- A battery with a very large capacity, 200,000 power units.

Surge Generator:
- Generates power from surge alloy 0.5 surge per sec > 600 power per sec.

Shine:
- A turret that shoots copper or bronze at very long distances, has moderate damage and slow reload time.

Glare:
- A turret that shoots copper, bronze, or thorium at very long distances, with a  faster reload time.

Small Drill:
- A 1x1 size drill that can mine titanium.

Lithium Filterer:
- Filters lithum out of water, 12 water > 1 lithium.

Mixer:
- Mixes water with sand to make muddy water, 2 sand + 1 water > 1 muddy water.

Sifter:
- Sifts muddy water to produce iron, titanium, or (more rarely) bismuth.

Induction Smelter:
- Smelts iron and coal together to make steel, 2 iron + 1 coal > 2 steel.

Bauxite Refiner:
- Refines bauxite into aluminium, 4 bauxite > 1 aluminium.

Bronze Alloyer:
- Melts copper and aluminium together to make bronze, 4 copper + 1 aluminium > 5 bronze.

Bismuth Crucible:
- Melts bismuth, 1 bismuth > 7 molten bismuth.

Irradiator:
- Irradiates molten bismuth to make thorium, 12 molten bismuth > 1 thorium.

Banshee Factory:
- Produces banshee miner drones, 50 silicon + 60 bronze + 20 aluminium > 1 banshee.

## Units:

Banshee:
- An advanced miner unit that can mine titanium.

## Modified Blocks

Duo + Salvo:
- Can now use bronze as ammo.

Wave:
- Can now use muddy water and molten bismuth as ammo.

Cryofluid Mixer:
- Requires lithium and titanium to make cryofluid.

Phantom, Wraith, Ghoul, Revenant Factories:
- Requires aluminium instead of titanium to make drones.

Several other blocks have also been modified to require steel to build.

## Modified Units

Draug:
- Will now mine copper, lead, and titanium.
